### ðŸ”¹ Big-O Notation  
Describes an **upper bound** on the growth rate of a function, f(n)=O(g(n)) means for sufficiently large n, f(n) â‰¤ CÂ·g(n).  
```python
# e.g., f(n)=3n+2 is O(n) because 3n+2 â‰¤ 5n for n â‰¥ 2
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ Big-Î˜ Notation
Gives a tight bound: f(n)=Î˜(g(n)) if C1Â·g(n) â‰¤ f(n) â‰¤ C2Â·g(n) for large n.

```python
# Merge Sortâ€™s time is Î˜(n log n) in worst and best cases.
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ Big-Î© Notation
Describes a lower bound: f(n)=Î©(g(n)) means f(n) â‰¥ CÂ·g(n) for large n.

```python
# Insertion Sort is Î©(n) in best case (already sorted).
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ Worst-Case vs Best-Case
â€¢ Worst-case: max time over all inputs of size n. \
â€¢ Best-case: min time.

```python
# Linear search: best Î©(1), worst O(n)
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ Amortized Analysis
Average cost per operation over a sequence, smoothing out spikes.

```python
# Dynamic array resizing: occasional O(n) on grow, but amortized O(1) insert.
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ Master Theorem (Divide & Conquer)
Recurrence T(n)=aT(n/b)+f(n) leads to three cases for comparing f(n) to n^(log_b(a)).

```python
# Merge Sort: T(n)=2T(n/2) + Î˜(n) â‡’ Î˜(n log n)
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ Rule of Sum & Product
â€¢ Sum (sequential): f(n)+g(n)=O(max(f(n),g(n)))
â€¢ Product (nested): f(n)*g(n)=O(f(n)Â·g(n))

```python
# Two nested loops: O(n) + O(m) = O(n+m); O(n) + O(n) = O(n)
```
